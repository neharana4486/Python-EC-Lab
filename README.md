MIneSweeper game consists of a 16x16 matrix A cell (square) can consist of a bomb, if you click a bomb you lose If you click a cell and it is NOT a bomb, you get a number that tells you how many bombs are nearby, the goal is to capture all squares that are not bombs

A cell can have a maximum of 8 squares next to it

Example: I click on a cell that has 8 neighbors, it is not a bomb, I get the number 4 This means that there are 4 bombs divided between some of the 8 cells, it is up to me to identify which are bombs and which which is not

Scenario 1: Clicks on a box and gets a bomb, I follow Scenario 2: Clicks on a box nearby but does NOT get a bomb, I drive on!

When all squares have been clicked that do not contain a bomb, you win!
